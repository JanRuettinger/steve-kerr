## Vision
Imagine having access to an health coach that knows your entire health history, all your activity data and all your sleep data from the moment you were born until this very second.
Then imagine that your health coach has read every research paper and listened to all health podcasts that are out there.
Oh and your health coach never sleeps and is available 24/7 via Whatsapp.

## Project plan
1. Store podcast transcripts into embedding database
2. Store reseach papers into embedding database
3. Store personal health records in database and translate them into a prompt to add context
4. Hide all the complexicty of step 1-3 behind a ChatGPT plugin so that the only has to provide his personal token and can ask a question to his health coach
5. Make the chat interface available over Whatsapp
